# Spotify.js

A simple Node.js module for interfacing with the Spotify API

credit to discord.js for helping me learn how to structure a library/wrapper like this and for the rest api request handlers.

I don't know how liscences work at all, but discord.js is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. If there is any problem let me know :)
